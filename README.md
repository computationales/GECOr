# The GECOr package

This package includes tools to generate datasets for {rsofun} and {rpmodel}, visualize their data output and provide all-round data wrangling support. The package will aggregate components previously found scattered around various other packages, where they were a poor fit or did not consolidate into a coherent whole.

The package is aimed at internal GECO use, but open to others. The package is provided AS IS, with not support provided to external parties.
